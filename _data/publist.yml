- title: 'Unsupervised Audio Visual Lecture Segmentation'
  image: avlectures.png
  description: Proposed video lecture segmentation that splits lectures into bite-sized topics. Approached this problem by first learning the lecture-clip representations by leveraging visual, textual, and OCR cues using a pretext self-supervised task of matching lecture narrations with temporally aligned visual content. Used these learned representations to temporally segment the lectures using an algorithm called TW-FINCH. Introduced a new dataset, AVLectures, a large-scale dataset consisting of 86 courses with over 2,350 lectures covering various STEM subjects from MIT-OpenCourseWare, which we used for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluating the segmentation performance.
